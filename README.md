# Data Analytics and Visualization Project
During my MBA studies at Johns Hopkins University, I developed a strong interest in data analytics and visualization. I took several courses, including Data Science-Statistics, Foundations of Business Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Machine Learning, Supply Chain Analytics, Big Data Consulting Project, and Customer Analytics. Among these, the Big Data Consulting Project and Customer Analytics courses particularly ignited my passion for exploring and working on projects enthusiastically.

I also had the opportunity to be a Teaching Assistant for the Data Visualization Course under Professor Mohammad Yazdi. In this role, I helped facilitate over 200 students in both the MS and MBA programs, assisting them in completing their exciting data visualization projects. You can check out their amazing projects here: (https://github.com/malamdar90/Tableau-Data-Visualization-Projects)

Through this platform, I aim to share some of my projects, showcasing my skills and enthusiasm in data analytics and visualization. I hope this helps fellow data science and visualization enthusiasts to learn and share ideas.
