# Data Analytics and Visualization Project
During my MBA studies at Johns Hopkins University, I developed a strong interest in data analytics and visualization. I took several courses, including Data Science-Statistics, Foundations of Business Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Machine Learning, Supply Chain Analytics, Big Data Consulting Project, and Customer Analytics. Among these, the Big Data Consulting Project and Customer Analytics courses particularly ignited my passion for exploring and working on projects enthusiastically.

I also had the opportunity to be a Teaching Assistant for the Data Visualization Course under Professor Mohammad Yazdi. In this role, I helped facilitate over 200 students in both the MS and MBA programs, assisting them in completing their exciting data visualization projects. You can check out their amazing projects here: (https://github.com/malamdar90/Tableau-Data-Visualization-Projects)

Through this platform, I aim to share some of my projects, showcasing my skills and enthusiasm in data analytics and visualization. I hope this helps data science and visualization enthusiasts to learn and share ideas.

## Step of Data Analytics Project
    - Determining the questions/insight you are going to address in the dashboard
    - Data Collection
    - Data Cleaning
    - Exploration: Hypothesis Development
    - Analysis: Confirmation
    - Interpreting and reporting the results

## 1. Olympic Medals Dashboard

### Project Overview
This data visualization project aims to provide insights into the performance of various countries in the Olympic Games over the years. By analyzing the medal counts and other relevant data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the countries' performance

### Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "olympic_medals.csv" file, containing detailed information about the number of medals won by each country in the Olympic Games over the years. This dataset includes variables such as country name, year, type of medal (gold, silver, bronze), and total medal count.
